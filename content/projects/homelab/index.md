My homelab is an environment which allows me to build, develop, learn and experiment with new tools, software and hardware in a safe and controller environment. 

I've been homelabbing for two years now (as of June 2020), and I've learnt a vast amount about networking, sysadming tools and techniques, dev/secops, among a wealth of other things.
