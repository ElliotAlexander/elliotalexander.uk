My name is Elliot Alexander. I'm a **developer**, **music-lover**, **homelabber** and all around **tech-enthusiast**. I'm a first-class **Comptuter Science** Graduate from the Univesity of Southampton, and have experience in building modern software solutions for industries ranging from bespoke defence projects to clinical informatics in the third world. I currently work at **Netcraft**, a cybersecrutiy company based in Bath, UK. 

When not programming, I enjoy reading, riding (and restoring) vintage road bikes, and sinking time into my homelab. I spent a lot of my time at local gigs or making music myself.
