I'm an avid linux/vim/terminal lover. If you're interested in my dotfiles, you can find them here.

Day to day, I rely on Arch/i3, and vim/tmux. I tend to prefer to read code / navigate new projects (where fzf isn't so effective) in vscode, and write code in vim.

I use [GNU Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/) to manage my dots.
