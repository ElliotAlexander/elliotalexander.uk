My first serious foray into reading again this year  was on a recommendation of a friend, Evelgn Waugh's 'Brideshead Revisited'. I've heard of Evelgn Waugh, and picked up BridesheadRevisited as my first experience with his writing (maybe against some of the advice from more seasoned readers of Waugh). 

Waugh, an Oxford educated journalist and satirist, is most known for Brideshead Revisited (1945) and his earlier novel Decline and Fall (1928). A well known socialite through the 30s, and religious convert after divorcing his first Wife, Waugh is an author who's success mostly came in a golden period pre-war. Following his service in the Royal Marines during the Second World War, Waugh's religious faith, fundamentalism and disillusionment with the sweeping social changes introduced in the Post war era grew, subjects he wrote extensively about during later years of his life. The publishing of Brideshead Revisited in 1945 brought him both fame and fortune, and Waugh continued to write autobiographically, as well as about his times travelling and experiences during the war, upto his death in 1966. During the later years of his career his writings were in decline, and his popularity waning, however his works gained a new appreciation and following in the years after his death. 

Bridehead Revisited is a introduced with an autobiographical element, with the novels main narrative being introduced through Charles' recollection of his earlier years while visiting Brideshead as a soldier during the war. Likewise, the early recollections of Charles' introduction to Sebastian at Oxford mirror (albeit from an outside perspective) Waugh's own experiences of 'The Hypocrites Club', an Oxford social group with stark paralells to Charles' relationship with Anthony Blaunche. This is far from the only autobiographical element in the novel, but it's inclusion as a the commencement of Charles' story. As a bildungsroman of sorts, certainly in a spirital sense, the book represents an illustration on some of the major themes of the authors own life, including his relationship with the church and spirituality, romantic relationships and the past. 

Brideshead Revisited is grounded almost entirely in the melancholy, in a romanticised lust for a past time or life. Much of this is reflected through Charles' original years at Oxford (a time of great formulation and development) and his early experiences at Brideshead, before it's beauty is unavoidably corrupted by the intrapersonal relationships he explores there over the narrative. At it's conclusion, the novels namesake represents something entirely different, a symbol of a crumbling age of aristocrats in a world fighting for both it's identity and it's morality. With each return to Brideshead, Charles finds it in a more diminished state than his last departure, concluding with it's use as a batallion headquarters during the war. This collapse seeps through the book, and holds some parallels to the collapse of the Flyte's faith. 

This is reflected again in the title of the first book, 'Et In Aracadia Ego', a 15th century painting by Nicolas Poussin traditionally associated with ideas of the rural idyll and idealized pastoral settings. N.B. The painting is hanging in the Louvre (I've been!) and is well worth a look if you're ever there. This sense of melancholy is aided by the position of Charles as narrator, looking wistfully backwards on a life lived in the confines of Brideshead and Oxford. There's an obvious question again here with Waugh's own resistance to change, both within wider society and the world as a whole. Charles' own recollections on an early life spent among the towering monuments of Britain's aristocracy reflect this. 

Like Brideshead, the novels various characters stand at their intellectual and personal peaks at the novels introduction, with the various characters all entering stages of discontent, addiction and struggle throughout their lives.
