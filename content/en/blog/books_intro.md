As a recent university graduate, I find myself with an abundance of both time and a recently refreshed attention span; a situation which has lent itself to rebooting a habit for more serious reading. I've been reading a lot since I was young, and have always greatly enjoyed it, although during University the obvious pressures of balancing a study and social life made finding the time and motivation to settle down with a book almost impossibly difficult. This is something I'm now happy to correct.


I plan to keep a log here (potentially backdated a little, to the start of this obviously weird year) of the books I read, and my thoughts on them. This might take the form of a mini review, or just some comments on passages and sections throughout the book I found particularly interesting or poignant. 

While this is mostly for my own logs and sanity (it can sometimes feels like the second you turn the last page of a book, you immediately lose and recollection of it's contents), but I hope if anyone does read this they take some interest or enjoyment from it, as I hope I will.
