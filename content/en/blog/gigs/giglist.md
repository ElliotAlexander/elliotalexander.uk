This is an idea I've shamelessly stolen from several other friends, who keep upto date lists of gigs and shows they've been to. I've been informally doing this on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/elliotalex97) for the best part of two years, and have been to a lot of gigs in that time. However, this seems like a much more reasonably way to keep track.

I'll be posting all post-pandemic gigs I make it out to here, maybe with a bit of a review.
